<h1>Hello, probably just Chris!</h1>
<p>Join me on my coding adventure. I am so lame! I need to figure out how to add a new line!</p>
<p>I need to figure out how to make a new paragraph!</p>
<p>Wow look all you need is < p> and < /p></p>
<p>How can you type the syntax as plain text? I have to put a space in front of the p so it doesn't start a new paragraph.</p>
